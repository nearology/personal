Welcome to my personal website! This is my first post here.

I'm Mohammad Amin Khazaei, a software engineer focused on embedded systems. I work on developing embedded Linux devices and I'm passionate about low-level programming, hardware-software integration, and building reliable embedded solutions.

This website will serve as my personal space to share thoughts, projects, and experiences related to embedded systems development and technology in general.

Thanks for visiting!
